This morning, the other interns and I continued to work on our project for the blog site. It was a challenging and slow process, especially when working through past errors that kept on persisting or new errors that popped up. In my branch, for example, my website stopped loading properly and only displayed an index of the site's HTML files instead of the actual site itself as it is supposed to be interpreted. I'm hoping that tomorrow I can fix that error and then finish up the front-end design of the site with the color-block heading on each page and writing out all the content. 

In the afternoon, Stella lead a Data Cleaning and Open Refine workshop which was interesting and, while not new, was still a new learning challenge. I had never used OpenRefine before, but basically it is a software or tool that provides a human-friendly of sorting through and cleaning big datasets. Having tried to clean datasets in Excel and R, this is definitely a way more straightforward approach. However, OpenRefine has fewer controls than GREL does, a sorting code, but it is harder to use without experience.  

I consider getting through another day at work a new accomplishment and I hope that gradually, I will have done this so much that it no longer feels so tiring at the end of the day. I'm proud of myself for sticking it through despite the expected ups and downs and learning somethings at the end of it. Even if I don't remember *everything* from today's workshop, I am continuing to build more confidence in my ability to learn new programs and ways of working with data and coding.
